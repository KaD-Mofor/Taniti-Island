        Almost all visitors arrive in Taniti by air, though some arrive on a small cruise ship that docks in Yellow Leaf Bay for one night per week. Taniti is served by a small airport that can accommodate small jets and propeller planes. The island is in the process of expanding the airport, so larger jets will be able to land on the island within the next few years.

        <h3>Ground Transportation</h3>
          <p>
            Public buses serve Tinati City and run from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. every day. Private buses serve the rest of the island. Taxis are available in Tinati City, and rental cars can be rented from a local rental agency near the airport. Bikes and helmets are available to rent from several vendors (helmets are required by law). Tinati City is fairly flat and very walkable. Many tourists stay in the area surrounding Merriton Landing: this area is easy to explore on foot.
